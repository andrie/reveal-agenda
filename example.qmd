# Motivation

## Why?

To help people follow the logical flow of a presentation, it is useful to show all top level headings in a single agenda slide.

But it can be tedious to construct an agenda slide by hand, by copying all the top level headings.

This extension automatically constructs an agenda slide from the top level headings.

# Mechanics

## Using the extension

Add this to the yaml header:

``` yaml
filters: 
  - reveal-auto-agenda
```

Then sit back and watch your agenda slide build itself.

## Where does the agenda show up?

The extension inserts the rolling agenda on every slide with H1 heading.

# Have fun

## That's it.

Have fun!
